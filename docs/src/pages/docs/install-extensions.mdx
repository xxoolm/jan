# Install Extensions

Jan comes with several [pre-installed extensions](/docs/extensions#core-extensions) that provide core functionalities. You can manually add custom third-party extensions at your own risk.

## Create Extensions

<Callout type="info">
Jan currently only accepts `.tgz` file format for extensions.
</Callout>

> **Heads Up:**
> - Please use the following structure and setup as a **reference** only.
> - You're free to develop extensions using any approach or structure that works for your needs. As long as your extension can be packaged as a `.tgz` file, it can be installed in Jan. Feel free to experiment and innovate!
> - If you already have your own `.tgz` extension file, please move forward to [install extension](/docs/install-extensions#install-extensions) step. 

#### Extension Structure
Your extension should follow this basic structure:

```
my-extension/
├── package.json           # Extension metadata and dependencies
├── dist/                 # Compiled JavaScript files
│   └── index.js         # Main extension entry point
├── src/                 # Source code
│   └── index.ts        # TypeScript source
└── README.md           # Extension documentation
```

#### Required package.json Fields
```json
{
  "name": "@your-org/extension-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "jan": {
    "type": "extension",
    "displayName": "Your Extension Name",
    "description": "Description of what your extension does"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "package": "npm pack"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    // List your dependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

#### Example Extension Template

You can find a template for creating Jan extensions in our [example repository](https://github.com/janhq/extension-template).
## Install Extensions 

To install a custom extension in Jan:

1. Navigate to [Jan Data Folder](/docs/data-folder):
2. Copy `.tgz` extension file into the extensions directory
3. Extract the `.tgz` file into its own folder under the extensions directory
4. Restart Jan

After restart, the `~/jan/data/extensions/extensions.json` file will be updated automatically to include your new extension.
